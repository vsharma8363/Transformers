**Terminology to know:**
- *Homogenization* - Process of training a model to carry out many tasks without fine tuning
- *Self-Supervised Learning* - ML training without inputs + labelled outputs
- *Foundational Models* - Name given to transformers because  of the paradigm change they have been causing

# I. History of Transformers

## Recurrent Neural Networks
  - Memorizes the state of a sequence in order to determine the future parts of the sequence

Example:
1. You feed it the sequence "I love to eat"
2. It guesses "pizza"
3. You tell it "food"
4. It learns to associate "I love to eat" with "food"

## Convolutional Neural Networks
- Designed by Yann LeCunn (Go Violets!)
- Fail to deal with long-term dependencies in lengthy + complex sequences

## Coreference Resolution
- Program used to find out which entity a word refers to

Example:
- In the sentence "I like pizza", what entity does "I" refer to?
